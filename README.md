The primary objective of this project was to construct a Multiple Linear Regression model with the capability to accurately predict taxi fare amounts. This prediction was based on a set of pertinent independent variables, and was designed to be made prior to the commencement of a taxi cab ride.

In the process of model development, it was observed that the coefficients which exhibited the strongest correlation with the dependent variable, fare_amount, were mean_duration and mean_distance. This finding was in line with expectations, as these variables intuitively have a direct impact on the fare amount.

The R-squared value obtained was sufficiently high, indicating that the model was able to explain a significant proportion of the variance in the fare_amount. This result served as a strong indicator of the modelâ€™s robust performance and its effectiveness in predicting taxi fare amounts based on the given independent variables. Thus, the project successfully achieved its goal of building a reliable predictive model for taxi fares.

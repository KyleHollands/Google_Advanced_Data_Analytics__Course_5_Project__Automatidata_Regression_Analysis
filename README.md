# Taxi Fare Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression
## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project was to construct a Multiple Linear Regression model capable of accurately predicting taxi fare amounts. Predictions were based on a set of pertinent independent variables and were designed to be made prior to the commencement of a taxi cab ride.

## Modeling and Evaluation
During model development, it was observed that the coefficients with the strongest correlation to the dependent variable, `fare_amount`, were `mean_duration` and `mean_distance`. This finding aligned with expectations, as these variables intuitively have a direct impact on fare amounts.

The R-squared value obtained was sufficiently high, indicating that the model explained a significant proportion of the variance in `fare_amount`. This result demonstrates the modelâ€™s robust performance and effectiveness in predicting taxi fares based on the given independent variables.

## Conclusion
The project successfully achieved its goal of building a reliable predictive model for taxi fares, leveraging key features such as trip duration and distance to generate accurate fare estimates.
